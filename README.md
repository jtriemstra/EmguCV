# EmguCV

I initially created https://github.com/jtriemstra/CowPuzzle to solve a puzzle. This was an attempt to add a visual dimension to that by identifying puzzle pieces in a picture, identifying the edges, finding the matches, and then displaying a solved puzzle. I never got sufficient success with the OpenCV algorithms in finding edges to do this. The most interesting project in this repo might be the KChainableTestRig, where I built a WinForms UI to run various algorithms and tune parameters.
